## Installation

Since this project is early in development, I've decided to not release any binaries yet.

You can however clone the repository and build the project yourself. The only dependencies you should need are [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Features & Roadmap

- [x] Browse & install mods
- [x] Mod config editor
- [x] Import & export profiles (compatible with r2modman/thunderstore)
- [x] Support for other BepInEx compatible games
- [ ] Support for other modding frameworks
